# alt shift on/off
## Hello

Ever played a game where you needed to press alft+shift (or maybe hit them on accident)and changed your langauge/took you out of game causing you crucial time? Well this code will go to your settings and turn it off!!

## The functions of the program

The program simulates keyboard input (so please when you press it let it work as if you touch anything else the program will work on what you touch) 

Program works for windows 10 and 11

## install imports

for the program to work you will need to install the imports
On visual studio code (what i use so i dont know how it will be on your ide) open the code, start a terminal then run= pip install PyQt6, pip install keyboard, pip install pyautogui
